# **AWS and Cloud Computing**

## **What is Cloud Computing?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet "the Cloud" to offer faster innovation, flexible, and economies of scale.

This includes:
- Servers
- Storage
- Networking
- Software
- Analytics
- Intelligence

## **What can you do with Cloud?**

- File storage
- Big data analytics
- Data backups and archiving
- Disaster recovery
- Software testing and development
- Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
- Platform as a service (PaaS)
- Communication
- Social networking

## **What are the 4 TYPES of Cloud?**

- `Private clouds` - Dedicated to a single organisation.
- `Public clouds` - resources are offered by a third-party provider via the internet and shared by organizations and individuals who want to use or purchase them.
- `Hybrid clouds` - computing environment that combines an on-premises datacenter (also called a private cloud) with a public cloud, allowing data and applications to be shared between them.
- `Multiclouds` - the presence of more than 1 cloud deployment of the same type (public or private), sourced from different vendors.

## **What are the different types of Cloud Service?**

- `Ifrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS)` - cloud service provider manages the infrastructure for you.
- `Platforms-as-a-Service (PaaS)` - the hardware and an application-software platform are provided and managed by an outside cloud service provider, but the user handles the apps running on top of the platform and the data the app relies on
- `Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)` - a service that delivers a software application—which the cloud service provider manages—to its users.

## **Advantages/Disadvantages of the Cloud (for business)**

### Advantages:

- Accessibility everywhere
- Centralised data security
- Higher performance and availability
- Quicker application deployment
- Business continuity

### Disadvantages:

- Data loss or theft
- Data leakage
- Insecure interfaces and APIs
- Technology vulnerabilities in shared environments
- Account hijacking

## **What is OpEx vs CapEx?**

There are a variety of costs and expenses which companies have to pay in order to continue running their businesses. These costs can be one-off or they can be recurring, and it can often be challenging to keep up with all of these expenses. But how are they able to keep track of all of them?

One way is to divide them up into different categories—the most common of which are capital expenditures (CapEx) and operating expenses (OpEx). Capital expenditures are major purchases that a company makes, which are used over the long term. Operating expenses, on the other hand, are the day-to-day expenses that a company incurs to keep its business running.

## **Marketshare - What is the breakdown?**

- 12-month revenues between the start of 2021 and 2022 for cloud infrastructure services reached $191 billion.
- AWS had the largest market share of cloud infrastructure services at 33% in Q1 2022.
- Microsoft Azure had a market share of 22% in Q1 2022, with Google at 10% and all other companies at 35%.
- In total, Amazon, Microsoft and Google accounted for 66% of the cloud market at the start of 2023.
- Public cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) revenue in 2022 was $111 billion.
- The cloud market is projected to be worth $376.36 billion by 2029.
- It’s estimated that the world will store 200 zettabytes (2 billion terabytes) in the cloud by 2025.
- The average cloud user spends around $400 monthly for a single server. Hosting the entire back-office infrastructure costs an average of $15,000 per month.
- Just 11% of organisations have encrypted between 81-100% of the sensitive data they store in the cloud.
