# Reverse proxies

## What is a proxy?

- A proxy server is an intermediate server that acts as a gateway between client devices and target servers or services, forwarding requests and responses.
- Proxies sit between client devices (such as computers or smartphones) and target servers (websites or other services).
- They serve as intermediaries, facilitating communication between clients and servers.

## What is a reverse proxy?

- A reverse proxy is a server or software application that sits between client devices (such as web browsers) and one or more backend servers (web servers, application servers, or other services).
- Unlike a forward proxy, which is used by clients to access the internet indirectly, a reverse proxy is used by backend servers to handle client requests.
